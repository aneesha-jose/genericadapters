# genericadapters
A pre-written generic adapter for recycler views and list views to be used during Android Development; to avoid the repeated creation and boiler plate code of writing dedicated adapters. Creation of view holders that inherit AbstractBetterViewHolder from the library is compulsory for every adapter.
